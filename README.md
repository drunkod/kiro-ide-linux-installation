# Kiro Linux Installer Script

## What is it?

This is an installer script for [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/), an AI-powered development environment by AWS. While AWS provides `.deb` packages for Debian-based Linux distributions and a universal `.tar.gz` file for other distributions, this script simplifies the installation process for any Linux distribution, including Fedora, Arch, openSUSE, and others.

## Why was it created?

This script was created to provide a seamless installation experience for Kiro on Linux distributions that don't have native package support. It handles all the necessary steps to properly install Kiro, including:

- Checking and installing dependencies
- Setting up proper file permissions
- Creating desktop entries for easy access
- Configuring system paths
- Managing updates and uninstallation

## How to use it

### Prerequisites

1. Download the Kiro `.tar.gz` file from [https://kiro.dev/](https://kiro.dev/)
2. Extract the downloaded `.tar.gz` file
3. Place this `install-kiro.sh` script at the same level as the extracted `Kiro` folder

### Directory structure should look like:

```
some-directory/
├── Kiro/             # The extracted Kiro folder from tar.gz
└── install-kiro.sh   # This installation script
```

### Installation

#### Option 1: Using the downloaded script

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x install-kiro.sh

# Run the installer
./install-kiro.sh         # For system-wide installation (requires sudo/root privileges)
# OR
./install-kiro.sh --user  # For user-only installation (no sudo required)
```

#### Option 2: Direct installation using GitHub URL

You can download and run the script directly from GitHub without having to download the script separately:

```bash
# Navigate to the extracted Kiro directory (where the Kiro folder is located)
cd path/to/extracted/directory

# Download and run the installer script in one command
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhilashiig/kiro-ide-linux-installation/main/install-kiro.sh | bash
# OR (for user-only installation)
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhilashiig/kiro-ide-linux-installation/main/install-kiro.sh | bash -s -- --user

# Alternatively using wget
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhilashiig/kiro-ide-linux-installation/main/install-kiro.sh | bash
# OR (for user-only installation)
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhilashiig/kiro-ide-linux-installation/main/install-kiro.sh | bash -s -- --user
```

### Upgrading Kiro

When a new version of Kiro is released:

1. Download the new `.tar.gz` file from [https://kiro.dev/](https://kiro.dev/)
2. Extract it to replace the existing `Kiro` folder
3. Run the upgrade command:

```bash
./install-kiro.sh --update         # For system-wide upgrade
# OR
./install-kiro.sh --update --user  # For user-only upgrade
```

### Uninstallation

```bash
./install-kiro.sh --uninstall                # System-wide uninstall
# OR
./install-kiro.sh --uninstall --user         # User-only uninstall
# OR
./install-kiro.sh --uninstall --clean        # Complete uninstall (removes all data)
```

## Additional Options

Run `./install-kiro.sh --help` to see all available options and commands.

## Compatibility

This script works on all major Linux distributions, including but not limited to:
- Fedora
- Arch Linux
- CentOS/RHEL
- openSUSE
- Ubuntu/Debian (although native .deb packages are available)
- Other Linux distributions

## Notes on Icons/Logo

Since the Kiro package may not include the official logo, this installer script attempts to use a placeholder icon from:

## Nix/NixOS Installation (Recommended for Nix users)

If you are a [Nix](https://nixos.org/) or [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) user, you can use the provided Nix flake to install Kiro in a declarative and reproducible way.

### How to Use This Flake

**1. Enable Flakes:**

If you haven't already, you'll need to enable Nix Flakes and the `nix-command` in your Nix configuration.

**2. Run the Application:**

You can run Kiro directly without installing it permanently:

```bash
# Run from GitHub
nix run github:abhilashiig/kiro-ide-linux-installation

# Or from a local clone
nix run .
```

**3. Install the Package:**

To install Kiro into your user profile:

```bash
nix profile install .
```

**4. Use in a NixOS Configuration:**

You can add it to your system's packages in `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:

```nix
# /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
{
  inputs.kiro-flake.url = "github:abhilashiig/kiro-ide-linux-installation";

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, kiro-flake, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.your-hostname = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      # ...
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      modules = [
        # ...
        ({ pkgs, ... }: {
          environment.systemPackages = [
            kiro-flake.packages.x86_64-linux.default
          ];
        })
      ];
    };
  };
}
```
